    "## Using the `WebLLM Chat` kernel to run built-in-ai LLMs as JupyterLite kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WebLLM Chat` kernel is derived from a JupyterLite kernel implemented by [Aleksandar Sekulovski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandar-s-486829128/) at https://github.com/aleks-s10/agent-client-kernel/tree/main/lite-kernel.  This version currently lives at https://github.com/fovi-llc/wiki3-ai-site/tree/main/lite-kernel with Python installer by [Jim White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespaulwhite/) and Copilot.  It will be moving to its own repo RSN.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a TS/JS kernel that wraps `@built-in-ai/web-llm` from https://github.com/jakobhoeg/built-in-ai which is an [AI SDK model provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/) for open-source models (using WebLLM) running directly in the browser by [Jakob Hoeg Mørk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-hoeg-moerk/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128679; Under Construction &#128679; ###\n",
    "Watch this space for a kernel using `@built-in-ai/core` which wraps the Chrome/Edge built-in AI Prompt API (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in).\n",
    "\n",
    "This version is a PoC towards a Zed Agent Client Protocol (ACP) kernel which not only runs local-first LLMs but also agents (including coding agents).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example using the default, a \"small\" LLM: [SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC](https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC) which is 360M parameters quantized to 4bit and is 130MB."

       "Building a skyscraper out of straw is a fun and challenging idea! While it's not exactly practical for a real-world skyscraper, let's explore the concept and the challenges involved:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Understanding the Challenges**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Strength and Stability:** Straw is generally flexible and not very strong. It's not a good choice for a skyscraper's structural support. Straw bales are often used for temporary structures or agricultural purposes, but not for permanent, high-rise buildings. \n",
       "* **Weight and Density:** Straw bales are relatively lightweight but their density is low. To create a stable structure that can withstand wind and gravity, you'd need to arrange them in a very specific and dense manner. \n",
       "* **Fire Safety:** Straw is a flammable material.  This is a major safety concern and would require extensive fireproofing measures.\n",
       "* **Scale and Design:** Constructing a skyscraper out of straw would require a massive amount of straw bales and specialized construction techniques.  You'd also need to develop innovative design approaches to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing structure.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Possible Approaches**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Modern Straw-Based Construction:** While a traditional skyscraper is unlikely, there are modern innovations using straw bales in construction. These include:\n",
       "    * **Straw-bale housing:** Straw bales can be used for building walls and partitions, offering good insulation and fire resistance.\n",
       "    * **Straw-bale insulation:** Straw bales can be used for insulation in walls and roofs. \n",
       "    * **Straw-bale construction for temporary structures:** Straw bale structures are often used for agricultural shelters, temporary housing, and farm buildings.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Imagining the Possibilities:**  If we're thinking more about a theoretical skyscraper, here are some potential ideas:\n",
       "    * **Straw-based composite material:**  Engineers could explore combining straw with other materials to create a stronger, more durable structure. \n",
       "    * **Structural support:** You'd need to develop innovative ways to provide structural support. This could involve:\n",
       "        * **Reinforcing with steel or other materials**\n",
       "        * **Using a core of concrete or a strong plastic material**\n",
       "        * **Developing a self-supporting straw structure** \n",
       "    * **Sustainable design:**  Straw-based skyscrapers could be designed with sustainability in mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Notes:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **It's not practical for real-world skyscrapers.** The challenges are too significant.\n",
       "* **Research and innovation are key!** If you're interested in exploring this concept further, you can learn more about straw-based construction and innovative materials and design. \n",
