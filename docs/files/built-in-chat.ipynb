       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Level 1: Basic - The Core Concept (Good for elementary school students or beginners)\n",
       "\n",
       "**What it is:**  The Pythagorean Theorem describes a specific relationship between the sides of a **right triangle**. A right triangle is a triangle with one angle that measures exactly 90 degrees (a \"right angle\").\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Theorem:**  The squared length of the longest side (called the **hypotenuse**) is equal to the sum of the squared lengths of the other two sides (called **legs**).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Formula:**  a² + b² = c²\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **a** and **b** are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs).\n",
       "*   **c** is the length of the longest side (hypotenuse).\n",
       "\n",
       "**What does it mean?** Imagine you built a square on each side of the right triangle. The area of the square built on the hypotenuse is equal to the combined areas of the squares built on the other two sides.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example:** If one leg is 3 units long (a=3) and the other leg is 4 units long (b=4), then:\n",
       "3² + 4² = c²\n",
       "9 + 16 = c²\n",
       "25 = c²\n",
       "c = √25 = 5\n",

       "**Building on the Basics:**  This level goes beyond simply memorizing the formula.  It involves understanding *why* the theorem works and how it can be applied to solve real-world problems.\n",

       "**Key Concepts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Right Triangles are Special:**  The Pythagorean Theorem *only* applies to right triangles. If you're not sure if you're dealing with a right triangle, you need to check for a 90-degree angle.\n",
       "*   **Hypotenuse is Always Longest:** The hypotenuse *must* be the longest side.  If you're given two sides and need to find the third, you need to identify the hypotenuse first.\n",
       "*   **Real-World Applications:**  The Theorem is used in many practical situations, such as:\n",
       "    *   Calculating distances.\n",
       "    *   Constructing buildings (making sure corners are square).\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",

       "**Problem-Solving:**  You can use the theorem to solve for any missing side of a right triangle *if you know the lengths of the other two sides*.\n",
       "\n",
       "**More Complex Scenarios:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Word Problems:** You need to translate the word problem into a geometric setup. This involves identifying right triangles and labeling the sides correctly.\n",
       "*   **Finding Missing Sides:**  You can solve for *a*, *b*, or *c* depending on what you're given.\n",
       "*   **Checking Solutions:**  After solving, you should always plug your answer back into the Pythagorean Theorem to ensure your solution is correct.\n",
